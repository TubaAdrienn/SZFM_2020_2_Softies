This game is about a snake which has a liking in apples.

Your goal is to feed the snake with as many apple as possible.
Everytime your snake eats an apple its stomach gets bigger and bigger.
Be careful because a long snake is harder to control than a smaller snake.
You must avoid the snake to crash into its own body 
because then your snake gets tangled, consequently you can not continue to eat apples and the game is over.
You should avoid crashing into the walls too because then your snake is hurt and your game is over.
A snake with a big belly is happier than a snake with a small belly.

Try to be the one who gets its snake the longest and happiest.
