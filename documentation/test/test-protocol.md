## Testing protocol

### Testing the UI elements

Testing the UI elements should be done manually by clicking each button and textfield and seeing if the element reacts to the action.

### What to look for in each view element:

* Main page: If each picture leads to to the Rules page.
* Rules page: If the rules textfield shows the rules, if the play button leads you to the game page, if the namefield appears/disappears as it should.
* 2048: If the cells move to the right key action, if the buttons react to action.
* Mastermind: If the buttons react to action. 
* Snake: If the snake moves in the grids, if the buttons react to action.
* Tic-Tac-Toe: If buttons react to action.

### Rules

* If you cannot fix the problem yourself, or don't know what causes the problem, consult with the Senior.
* If somethings throws an error bugfix tasks should be issued on Trello with the description of the problem and after fixing that problem, new tests should be implemented.
*  Everything should look and work as expected.
*  Screenshots are appriciated.

### Testing the backend
Backend should be tested by using automated JUnit tests. Each gamestate and their methods which contain business logic should be tested.

### Rules

* If you cannot fix the problem yourself, or don't know what causes the problem, consult with the Senior.
* If somethings throws an error bugfix tasks should be issued on Trello with the description of the problem and after fixing that problem, new tests should be implemented.
*  Only perfect functionality is acceptable here so everything should look and work as expected.
*  Screenshots are appriciated.

### Database

* There is no actual automated way to test databases supported by JUnit so those tests should be done manually.
