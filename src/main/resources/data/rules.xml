        <game>snake</game>
        <desc>  This game is about a snake which has a liking in
  apples. Your goal is to feed the snake with as
  many apple as possible. Everytime your snake
  eats an apple its stomach gets bigger and
  bigger. Be careful because a long snake is
  harder to control than a smaller snake. You
  must avoid the snake to crash into its own body
  because then your snake gets tangled,
  consequently you can not continue to eat apples
  and the game is over. You should avoid crashing
  into the walls as well because then your snake
  is hurt and your game is over. A snake with a
  big belly is happier than a snake with a small
  belly. Try to be the one who gets its snake
  the longest and happiest.</desc>
