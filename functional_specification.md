## Current Situation Description
We are a group of teacher from the nearby elementary school who would like to give some modernization to our playtime with the children. Our school is, aided by the government, for children living in a low quality environment. For the children under 5th grade, afterschool activity is obligatory. During this time we help them to concentrate on solving their homework and refreshing the content they learnt that day. After they finished with their studies we usually reward our children with some playtime to relax and lift the mood. Either the whole class plays together or the class is separated in little groups playing with different games. Under games we mean mastermind, tic-tac-toe, guess who i am, career charades and a lot more. The problem is that the school is on low budget. Our game boards are broken by the children, the chalks and paper are running out because of using them while playing. Every classroom contains a computer available for teachers. We want to reward our hard working children with some computer games too.
